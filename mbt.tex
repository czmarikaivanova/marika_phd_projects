\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
The minimum broadcast time (MBT) problem consists of a set of communication nodes with a subset of source nodes. 
The task is to disseminate a signal to every node in a shortest possible time $t^*$ (delay), while abiding by communication rules.
An \emph{informed} node is a node that has received the signal.
Otherwise, a node is \emph{uninformed}.
At the beginning, the set of informed nodes is exactly the set of sources.
An informed node $u$ can send the signal to an uninformed node $v$ if $u$ and $v$ are located within a communication vicinity of each other.

The time is divided into discrete time steps.
At each time step, every informed node can forward the signal to at most one uninformed neighbor.
The number of informed nodes at some time step can therefore be no more than the double of the number of informed nodes at the previous time step.
%\subsection{Motivation and Related Work}
%This communication protocol differs from various wireless communication models where a signal can be relayed to all nodes within a visibility range of a sender.
This communication protocol appears in various practical application such as communication among computer processors or telephone networks.
%The applications are however not confined to wired networks.
Situations where the signals have to cover large distances typically assume sending the signal to one neighbor at a time.
This is common in satellite communication.

{Literature overview}

MBT has been shown to be NP-complete on arbitrary graphs in \cite{slater81}. 
The problem remains NP-complete even for several restricted communication networks \cite{jansen95} such as
split graphs with delay $t^*=2$, chordal graphs,
bipartite and planar graphs with maximum degree 3 and a single source,
several variants of grid graphs,
bipartite planar graphs with delay $t^*=2$ and maximum degree 3. 
Yet another NP-completeness result for 3-regular planar graphs with delay 2 is shown in \cite{middendorf93}.
The problem is known to be polynomial in trees \cite{slater81}.
Whether the problem is polynomial or NP-complete for split graphs with a single source was stated as an open questions in \cite{jansen95}, and hasn't been answered yet to our best knowledge.

A number of inexact methods for both general and special graph classes has been proposed in the literature during the last three decades.
One of the first works of this category is \cite{scheuermann84}, 
where the authors introduce an exact dynamic programming algorithm based on generating all maximum matchings in an induced bipartite graph.
Additional contribution of \cite{scheuermann84} are heuristic approaches for near optimal broadcasting.
From more recent works we mention \cite{hasson04}, which describes a meta heuristic algorithm for MBT, and provides a comparison with other existing methods.
The communication model is considered in an existing satellite navigation system in \cite{chu17}, where a greedy inexact methods is proposed together with a non-linear mathematical model.
Examples of additional efficient heuristics can be found e.g. in \cite{harutyunyan06,harutyunyan14,wang10,jimborean13}.

Approximation algorithms for MBT are studied in \cite{kortsarz95}. 
The authors argue that methods presented in \cite{scheuermann84} provide no guarantee on the performance and state an $n$-node wheel as an example of an unfavourable instance.
They introduce an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$-additive approximation algorithm for broadcasting in general graphs.
They further provide approximation algorithms for several graph classes with small separators with approximation ratio proportional to the separator size times $\log n$.
Another algorithm with $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n}\right)$-approximation\footnote{All logarithms in this paper are of base 2} ratio is given in~\cite{elkin03}.
Most of the works above consider a single source.

A related problem extensively studied in the literature is the minimum broadcast graph \cite{grigni91,mcgarvey16}. 
A broadcast graph supports a broadcast from any node to all other nodes in optimal time $\lceil\log n\rceil$.
For a given $n$, the effort is to determine properties such as the minimum number of edges and the minimum degree in broadcast graph on $n$ nodes.
The authors of \cite{mcgarvey16} study ILP models for $c$-broadcast graphs, a generalization of the problem that allows transmission of the signal to at most $c$ neighbours in a single time step.

\section{Network Model and Definitions}

The communication network is represented by a connected graph $G=(V,E)$ and a subset $S\subseteq V$ referred to as the set of sources, where $|V|=n$. 
Let $V\left[F\right]=\{v\in V:\text{ some edge in } F \text{ is incident to } v\}, F\subseteq E$.
For disjoint node sets $V_1,V_S\subseteq V$, we denote by $G\left[V_1,V_2\right]$ the bipartite graph $(V_1\cup V_2,E')$, where  $E'=\{\{u,v\}\in E: u\in V_1,v\in V_2\}$. 

\begin{definition}
The \emph{broadcast time} $\tau(G,S)$ of a node set $S\subseteq V$ in $G$ is defined as: 
\begin{equation*}
\tau(G,S)=
\begin{cases}
	0, S=V,\\
	1+\min\{\tau(G,S\cup V\left[M\right]):M \text{ is a matching in } G\left[S, V\setminus S\right]\}, S\neq V.
\end{cases}
\label{eq:btime}
\end{equation*}
\end{definition}
%Broadcasting is defined as a sequence of sets $(S=V_0\subseteq\dots\subseteq V_k = V)$ where each $V_i$ represents the nodes informed after time step $i$, $0\leq i\leq t$.
%For each node $v\in V_i\setminus V_{i-1}$, there exists a single node $\pi(v)\in V_{i-1}$ adjacent to $v$, which forwarded the signal to $v$.
%Also, for every two nodes $u,v\in V_i\setminus V_{i-1}$ we have $\pi(u)=\pi(v)$.
%The value $k$ is referred to as \emph{delay}.
The optimization problem in question is formulated as follows \cite{jansen95,middendorf93}:
\begin{problem}\label{prob:min}
Given $G=(V,E)$ and $S\subseteq V$, find a sequence $(S=V_0\subseteq\dots\subseteq V_{\tau(G,S)}=V)$ and a function $\pi:V\setminus S\to V$, such that for each $v\in V\setminus S:\{v,\pi(v)\}\in E$, and for each $u,v\in V_i\setminus V_{i-1}: \pi(u)=\pi(v)\Leftrightarrow u=v$.
\end{problem}

Given a feasible sequence of node sets and $\pi$, we derive the following broadcast trees \cite{grigni91}:
For $s\in S$, a broadcast tree $T_s=(V_{T_s},E_{T_s})$ is a time-labeled directed subgraph of $G$ describing a broadcast originated in $s$ by the rules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $T_s$ is rooted at $s$ with arcs directed towards the leaves.
\item each node $v\in V_i$ is labeled with an integer $\tau(v)=i$,
\item for $v\in V\setminus S, v\in V_{T_s}\Leftrightarrow \pi(v)\in V_{T_s}$, 
\item $E_{T_s}=\{\{u,v\}: u,v\in V_{T_s}, \pi(v)=u\}$, and
\item for two sources $s,s'\in S, s\neq s'$ we have that $V_{T_s}\cap V_{T_{s'}}=\emptyset$. 
\end{enumerate}

Any feasible sequence of node sets and $\pi$ yield a set of trees $T=\{T_s:s\in S\}$ that forms a partition of $G$ into trees referred to as \emph{broadcast forest}.
The number of leaves leaves in $T_s$ is denoted by $L(T_s)$.
The function $\alpha:V\to S$ associates a node $v$ with the source in which the tree containing $v$ is rooted.

Given a broadcast forest $T$, the delay is determined as $\max_{v\in V}\{\tau(v)\}$.
%A set of trees $T=\{T_s:\cup_{s\in S}V_{T_s}=V\}$ forms a partition of $G$ into trees referred to as \emph{broadcast forest}.
%$T$ can be derived from a given sequence of sets of nodes defining broadcasting and the mapping $\pi$.
For any integer $i$, let $T^i_s$ be the subtree of $T_s$ obtained by pruning all nodes $v\in V_{T_s}$ with $\tau(v)>i$.
Analogously, we define $T^i=\{T^i_s:s\in S\}$. 


%We also define the set $A=\{(i,j),(j,i):\{i,j\}\in E\}$ that consists of all arcs that can be derived by directing edges in $E$.
The degree of node $v$ in $G$ is denoted by $\text{deg}_G(v)$.
If $G$ is directed, $\text{deg}^-_G(v)$ and $\text{deg}^+_G(v)$ denote in-degree and out-degree, respectively.
For the diameter of $G$ we use the symbol $\Delta_G$.
Whenever there is no danger of confusion, the subscript $G$ is omitted.
The set of neighbors of $v\in V$ in $G$ is denoted by $N(v)$ and $N^+(v)$ in directed graphs.

%For convenience, we consider the following definition of broadcast trees \cite{grigni91}:
%For $s\in S$, a broadcast tree $T_s$ with node set $V_{T_s}$ is a time-labeled directed subgraph of $G$ describing a broadcast originated by $s$ by the following rules:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item $T_s$ is rooted at $s$ with arcs directed towards the leaves.
%\item Each node $v$ is labeled with an integer $\tau(v)$, where $\tau(s)=0$.
%\item Whenever $v$ is a parent of $u$ in $T_s$ $\tau(v)<\tau(u)$.
%\item Whenever $v$ and $u$ are siblings in $T_s$, $\tau(v)\neq \tau(u)$. 
%\end{enumerate}
%The number of leaves in $T_s$ is denoted by $L(T_s)$.
\input{sect3-exact-methods.tex}

\section{Lower bounds}
In this section, we study lower bounds on the delay for several restrictions of input graphs.
%An optimal solution is obtained by solving a sequence of decision problems with varying $t$. 
%It is therefore desirable to determine tight lower and upper bounds in order to arrive in the optimum after solving as few decision problems as possible.
Obvious bounds for a general graph instance are given by
\begin{observation}
For an instance $(G,S)$ of Problem \ref{prob:min},
$$\left\lceil\log\frac{n}{|S|}\right\rceil\leq t^* \leq n-|S|.$$
\end{observation}

In the following, we use $m$-step Fibonacci numbers \cite{noe05}, a generalization of well known (2-step) Fibonacci numbers, defined by letting, 
$F^{(m)}_k=0$ for $k\leq 0$, $F^{(m)}_1=1$, and 
other terms according to linear recurrence relation 
\begin{align*}
F^{(m)}_k &=\sum\limits_{i=1}^m F^{(m)}_{k-i}, &\text{ for } k\geq 2.
\end{align*}

Consider a $d$-regular graph with a unique source $s$.
Any broadcast forest consists of a single tree $T_s$.
We investigate the number of leaves in $T_s$, and derive a lower bound on the delay for this graph class.

If the orientation of arcs in $T_s$ is disregarded, $L(T^1_s)=L(T^2_s)=2$.
For $i\geq 3$, $L(T^i_s)$ equals the number of nodes with degree $1,\dots,d-1$ in $T^{i-1}_s$, 
because in a $d$-regular graph, only nodes with degree lower than $d$ can inform new uninformed nodes.
It can also be interpreted as the sum of the number of leaves in $T^{i-d+1}_s,\dots,T^{i-1}_s$, which leads to %the following formula
\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:leafrec}
L(T^i_s)=\sum\limits_{j=i-d+1}^{i-1} L(T^j_s).
\end{equation*}  
This formula equals to the recursive definition of Fibonacci sequence of order $d-1$.
As each of the two base cases, $L(T^1_s)$ and $L(T^2_s)$, equals the double of the base cases of the Fibonacci sequence, the number of leaves in time step $i$ is calculated as
\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:fibleaf}
L(T^i_s)=2 F^{(d-1)}_i.
\end{equation*}  
The number of nodes in $T^i_s$ can be expressed as the sum of nodes newly informed in time steps $1,\dots,i$, that is, the sum of leaves in $T^1_s,\dots,T^i_s$. Thus,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fibcnt}
|V_{T^i_s}|=|V_i|=2\sum\limits_{j=1}^i F^{(d-1)}_j.
\end{equation}

\begin{proposition}
For a $d$-regular graph on $n$ nodes and $|S|$ sources, a lower bound on the delay is 
\begin{equation*}
\label{lem:lbreg1}
\underline{t}=\left\lceil\min\{k:2s\sum\limits_{j=1}^k F^{(d-1)}_j\geq n\}\right\rceil.
\end{equation*}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
In order to inform $n$ nodes in the best possible scenario, the signal has to be relayed sufficiently many time steps so that the maximum possible number of informed nodes becomes $n$.
The maximum number of nodes informed within $i$ time steps is given by \eqref{eq:fibcnt}.
We therefore need to set the upper limit of the summation in \eqref{eq:fibcnt} so that the right-hand side exceeds $n$.
The reason why the result is divided by $|S|$ is that the best case scenario with several source nodes assumes that the signals initiated in individual sources are spread evenly.
\qed
\end{proof}

An additional knowledge of a degree sequence of $G$ can be exploited. 
\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:degorder}
Let $(d_1,\dots,d_n)$ be a degree sequence and $t\leq \bar{t}-|S|$ a given delay.
Consider all possible instances of which graphs are described by this degree sequence.
The maximum number of nodes informed within $t$ time steps is achieved in an instance in which it is possible to inform  nodes in the order of their decreasing degree.

In other words, the instance with the shortest possible broadcast time is such that its nodes can be informed in the order of their decreasing degree.

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
A node with degree $d_i$ informed in $i$-th time step can inform at most $\min\{d_i-1,t-i\}$ nodes.
Consider $l,k$ such that $1\leq k < \ell\leq n$ and nodes $v_k$, $v_\ell$ with $\deg(v_k)=d_k$ and $\deg(v_\ell)=d_\ell$.
Then, $d_k-1>d_\ell-1$ and $t-k > t-\ell$.
If nodes are informed in the order of their decreasing degree, let $K_1$ and $L_1$ be the number of nodes that can be informed by $v_k$ and $v_l$, respectively:
$$
K_1=\min\{d_k-1,t-k\}, ~~~ L_1=\min\{d_\ell-1,t-\ell\}.
$$
If the order in which $v_k$ and $v_l$ are informed is switched, i.e. when $v_k$ and $v_\ell$ is informed in the $\ell$-th and $k$-th time step, respectively, 
we use $K_2$ and $L_2$ to denote the maximum number of nodes informed by $v_k$ and $v_\ell$:
$$
K_2=\min\{d_k-1,t-\ell\} ~~~ L_2=\min\{d_\ell-1,t-k\}.
$$
We now investigate what possible values can the expression 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:degbounds}
(K_1+L_1)-(K_2+L_2)
\end{equation}
attain.
Observe that $K_1\geq L_2$ and $K_2\geq L_1$. 
If $K_2>L_1$, then $K_2=K_1=d_k-1$.
But in that case, $L_2=L_1=d_\ell-1$. 
We conclude that \eqref{eq:degbounds} always takes a non-negative value.
Therefore, if the nodes are informed in the order of their decreasing degrees,
the number of informed nodes within the give time step is no worse than when the nodes are informed in any other order.
\qed
\end{proof}

Alg.~\ref{alg:dreg} calculates a lower bound on the delay when given number of nodes, sources and a degree sequence in $G$ as an input.
The algorithm iteratively updates possible node degrees in $T^k$ in each time step $k$, and records the maximum possible number of nodes in $V_k$.
For the purpose of finding lower bounds, it is assumed that each node $v\in V_k$ with $\deg_{T^k}(v)<\deg_G(v)$ informs a new uninformed node.
The number of iterations is then the lowest possible delay for given input.
%The main idea is that in the most optimistic case, each node $v\in V_i$ with $\text{deg}_{F_i}(v)<\text{deg}_G(v)$ informs new not yet informed node.
%For the purpose of finding lower bounds, we can assume without loss of generality that $\text{deg}_{F_i}(u)\leq\text{deg}_{F_i}(v) \Leftrightarrow \text{deg}_G(u)\geq \text{deg}_G(v)$.
Once a node $v$ reaches its maximum degree, i.e., when $\text{deg}_{T^k}=\deg_G(v)$ for some $k$, $v$ does not inform any other node in the next time steps.

%For each $i=1,\dots d$, Alg. \ref{alg:dreg} keeps the  number of nodes with degree $i$.
%These values are updated iteratively using dynamic programming until the number of informed nodes reaches $n$. 

\begin{algorithm}
\KwData{$n,m,d_1,\dots,d_n\in \mathbb{N}, m\leq n,\newline 1\leq d_n\leq\dots\leq d_2\leq d_1$}
$a_1\leftarrow\dots\leftarrow a_{m}\leftarrow 1$\;%\tcp{this is a comment}
$a_{m+1}\leftarrow\dots\leftarrow a_{n}\leftarrow 0$\;%\tcp{this is a comment}
$c\leftarrow m$;%\tcp{every source informs a new node}
$~k\leftarrow 0$\;
\While {$c<n$} {
$k\leftarrow k+1$\;
$c_n\leftarrow 0$\;
\For{$i=1,\dots,c$} {
	\If {$a_i<d_i$} {
		$a_i\leftarrow a_i + 1$\;
		$c_n\leftarrow c_n + 1$\;
		\If {$c+c_n\leq n$} {
			$a_{c+c_n}\leftarrow 1$;\tcp{Newly informed node} 
		}
	}
}
$c\leftarrow c + c_n$\;
}
\Return $k$\;
%\Return $\lceil k/s \rceil$\;
 \caption{Lower bound exploiting distribution of degrees}
\label{alg:dreg}
\end{algorithm}

The input is assumed to be correct in the sense that a graph with the given degree sequence exists, and by definition, the degree sequence is ordered non-increasingly.
For each iteration $k$, Alg.~\ref{alg:dreg} stores degrees of nodes in $T^k$ in variables $a_1,\dots,a_n$.
Note that the forest $T^k$ is not actually constructed. 
The algorithm operates merely with potential degrees of nodes in $T^k$.
Next, variable $c$ keeps the value $|V_k|$, i.e., the number nodes informed within $k$ steps.
Finally, $c_n$ stores $|V_k\setminus V_{k-1}|$, thus the number of nodes newly informed in time step $k$.

\begin{proposition}
If $G$ is an arbitrary graph with $n$ nodes, $m$ sources and node degrees $d_i$, $1\leq i\leq n$, Alg.~\ref{alg:dreg} calculates a lower bound on the delay in $G$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The assumption that nodes with higher degree in $G$ are informed first in the optimal solution is justified by Lemma \ref{lemma:degorder}.
In each iteration $k$, degrees in $T^k$ of maximum possible number of nodes are increased in the order of their decreasing degree.
The current maximum possible number of informed nodes is stored in the variable $c$, and is updated at the end of the outre loop.
So, when the condition $c<n$ is tested on line 7, $c$ contains the correct value of number of nodes in $V_k$.
As soon as it is possible that at least $n$ nodes are informed, the algorithm returns the number of necessary iterations.
\qed
