\section{Concluding Remarks}

This work focuses on the minimum broadcast time problem and presents several techniques for determining lower bounds, upper bounds as well as optimal solutions.
The main contribution consists in introducing two different integer programming models and their comparison.
We consider various instance types and sizes both from existing datasets and randomly generated.
