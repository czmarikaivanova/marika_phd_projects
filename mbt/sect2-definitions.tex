\section{Network Model and Definitions} \label{sec:def}

The communication network is represented by a connected graph $G=(V,E)$ and a subset $S\subseteq V$ referred to as the set of sources.
We denote the number of nodes and the number of sources by $n=|V|$ and $\sigma=|S|$, respectively. 

\begin{definition} \label{def:broadcasttime}
The \emph{broadcast time} $\tau(G,S)$ of a node set $S\subseteq V$ in $G$ is defined as the smallest integer $t\geq 0$ for which there exist
a sequence $V_0\subseteq\dots\subseteq V_t$ of node sets and a function $\pi:V\setminus S\to V$, such that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $V_0=S$ and $V_t=V$, \label{def:boundary}
  \item for all $v\in V\setminus S$, $\{v,\pi(v)\}\in E$, \label{def:edge}
  \item for all $i=1,\ldots,t$ and all $v\in V_i$, $\pi(v)\in V_{i-1}$, and \label{def:parent}
  \item for all $u,v\in V_i\setminus V_{i-1}$, $\pi(u)=\pi(v)$ only if $u=v$. \label{def:unique}
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Referring to Section \ref{intro}, the node set $V_i$ is the set of nodes that are informed in time step $i$.
Initially, only the sources are informed ($V_0=S$), whereas all nodes are informed after $t$ time steps ($V_t=V$),
and the set of informed nodes is monotonously non-decreasing ($V_{i-1}\subseteq V_i$ for $i=1,\ldots,t$).
The parent function $\pi$ maps each node to the node from which it received the signal.
Conditions \ref{def:edge}--\ref{def:parent} of Definition \ref{def:broadcasttime} thus reflect that the sender is a neighbor node in $G$,
and that it is informed at an earlier time step than the recipient node.
Because each node can send to at most one neighbor node in each time step,
condition \ref{def:unique} states that $\pi$ maps the set of nodes becoming informed in step $i$ to distinct parent nodes.

The optimization problem in question is formulated as follows:
\begin{problem}[\textsc{Minimum Broadcast Time}]\label{prob:min}
Given $G=(V,E)$ and $S\subseteq V$, find $\tau(G,S)$.
\end{problem}

\begin{definition} \label{def:broadcastgraph}
For any $V_0,\ldots,V_t$ and $\pi$ satisfying the conditions of Definition \ref{def:broadcasttime},
the corresponding \emph{communication forest} is
the digraph $D=(V,A)$, where $A=\left\{\left(v,\pi(v)\right): v\in V\right\}$.
Each connected component of $D$ is a \emph{communication tree}.
\end{definition}

\noindent
It is easily verified that the communication trees are indeed arborescences, rooted at distinct sources, with arcs pointing away from the source.
Let $T(s)=\left(V(s),A(s)\right)$ denote the communication tree in $D$ rooted at source $s\in S$,
and let $T_i(s)$ be the subtree of $T(s)$ induced by $V(s)\cap V_i$.
Analogously, let $D_i$ be the directed subgraph of $D$ induced by node set $V_i$.
For the sake of notational simplicity, the dependence on $(V_0,\ldots,V_t,\pi)$ is suppressed when referring to the directed graphs introduced here.

The degree of node $v$ in graph $G$ is denoted by $\delta_G(v)$.
The set of neighbors of $v\in V$ in $G$ is denoted by $N_G(v)$.
% Whenever there is no risk of confusion, the subscript $G$ is omitted.
For a given subset $U\subseteq V$ of nodes, we define $N_G(U)=\bigcup_{v\in U}N_G(v)$.

Likewise, $\delta^-_D(v)$ and $\delta^+_D(v)$ denote, respectively, the in-degree and the out-degree of $D$,
and $N_D^+(v)=\left\{u\in V:(v,u)\in A\right\}$ and $N_D^-(v)=\left\{u\in V:(u,v)\in A\right\}$ denote the neighbor sets of node $v$ in $D$.
