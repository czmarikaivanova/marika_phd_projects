\section{Lower bounds}
In this section, we study lower bounds on the delay for several restrictions of input graphs.
%An optimal solution is obtained by solving a sequence of decision problems with varying $t$. 
%It is therefore desirable to determine tight lower and upper bounds in order to arrive in the optimum after solving as few decision problems as possible.
Obvious bounds for a general graph instance are given by
\begin{observation}
For an instance $(G,S)$ of Problem \ref{prob:min},
\begin{equation}
\left\lceil\log\frac{n}{|S|}\right\rceil\leq t^* \leq n-|S|.
\label{eq:loglb}
\end{equation}
\label{obs:loglb}
\end{observation}

In the following, we use $m$-step Fibonacci numbers \cite{noe05}, a generalization of well known (2-step) Fibonacci numbers, defined by letting, 
$F^{(m)}_k=0$ for $k\leq 0$, $F^{(m)}_1=1$, and 
other terms according to linear recurrence relation 
\begin{align*}
F^{(m)}_k &=\sum\limits_{i=1}^m F^{(m)}_{k-i}, &\text{ for } k\geq 2.
\end{align*}

Consider a $d$-regular graph with a unique source $s$.
Any broadcast forest consists of a single tree $T_s$.
We investigate the number of leaves in $T_s$, and derive a lower bound on the delay for this graph class.

If the orientation of arcs in $T_s$ is disregarded, $L(T^1_s)=L(T^2_s)=2$.
For $i\geq 3$, $L(T^i_s)$ equals the number of nodes with degree $1,\dots,d-1$ in $T^{i-1}_s$, 
because in a $d$-regular graph, only nodes with degree lower than $d$ can inform new uninformed nodes.
It can also be interpreted as the sum of the number of leaves in $T^{i-d+1}_s,\dots,T^{i-1}_s$, which leads to %the following formula
\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:leafrec}
L(T^i_s)=\sum\limits_{j=i-d+1}^{i-1} L(T^j_s).
\end{equation*}  
This formula equals to the recursive definition of Fibonacci sequence of order $d-1$.
As each of the two base cases, $L(T^1_s)$ and $L(T^2_s)$, equals the double of the base cases of the Fibonacci sequence, the number of leaves in time step $i$ is calculated as
\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:fibleaf}
L(T^i_s)=2 F^{(d-1)}_i.
\end{equation*}  
The number of nodes in $T^i_s$ can be expressed as the sum of nodes newly informed in time steps $1,\dots,i$, that is, the sum of leaves in $T^1_s,\dots,T^i_s$. Thus,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fibcnt}
|V_{T^i_s}|=|V_i|=2\sum\limits_{j=1}^i F^{(d-1)}_j.
\end{equation}

\begin{proposition}
For a $d$-regular graph on $n$ nodes and $|S|$ sources, a lower bound on the delay is 
\begin{equation*}
\label{lem:lbreg1}
\underline{t}=\left\lceil\min\{k:2s\sum\limits_{j=1}^k F^{(d-1)}_j\geq n\}\right\rceil.
\end{equation*}
\label{prop:lbfib}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
In order to inform $n$ nodes in the best possible scenario, the signal has to be relayed sufficiently many time steps so that the maximum possible number of informed nodes becomes $n$.
The maximum number of nodes informed within $i$ time steps is given by \eqref{eq:fibcnt}.
We therefore need to set the upper limit of the summation in \eqref{eq:fibcnt} so that the right-hand side exceeds $n$.
The reason why the result is divided by $|S|$ is that the best case scenario with several source nodes assumes that the signals initiated in individual sources are spread evenly.
\qed
\end{proof}

An additional knowledge of a degree sequence of $G$ can be exploited. 
\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:degorder}
Let $(d_1,\dots,d_n)$ be a degree sequence and $t\leq \bar{t}-|S|$ a given delay.
Consider all possible instances of which graphs are described by this degree sequence.
The maximum number of nodes informed within $t$ time steps is achieved in an instance in which it is possible to inform  nodes in the order of their decreasing degree.

In other words, the instance with the shortest possible broadcast time is such that its nodes can be informed in the order of their decreasing degree.

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
A node with degree $d_i$ informed in $i$-th time step can inform at most $\min\{d_i-1,t-i\}$ nodes.
Consider $l,k$ such that $1\leq k < \ell\leq n$ and nodes $v_k$, $v_\ell$ with $\deg(v_k)=d_k$ and $\deg(v_\ell)=d_\ell$.
Then, $d_k-1>d_\ell-1$ and $t-k > t-\ell$.
If nodes are informed in the order of their decreasing degree, let $K_1$ and $L_1$ be the number of nodes that can be informed by $v_k$ and $v_l$, respectively:
$$
K_1=\min\{d_k-1,t-k\}, ~~~ L_1=\min\{d_\ell-1,t-\ell\}.
$$
If the order in which $v_k$ and $v_l$ are informed is switched, i.e. when $v_k$ and $v_\ell$ is informed in the $\ell$-th and $k$-th time step, respectively, 
we use $K_2$ and $L_2$ to denote the maximum number of nodes informed by $v_k$ and $v_\ell$:
$$
K_2=\min\{d_k-1,t-\ell\} ~~~ L_2=\min\{d_\ell-1,t-k\}.
$$
We now investigate what possible values can the expression 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:degbounds}
(K_1+L_1)-(K_2+L_2)
\end{equation}
attain.
Observe that $K_1\geq L_2$ and $K_2\geq L_1$. 
If $K_2>L_1$, then $K_2=K_1=d_k-1$.
But in that case, $L_2=L_1=d_\ell-1$. 
We conclude that \eqref{eq:degbounds} always takes a non-negative value.
Therefore, if the nodes are informed in the order of their decreasing degrees,
the number of informed nodes within the give time step is no worse than when the nodes are informed in any other order.
\qed
\end{proof}

Alg.~\ref{alg:dreg} calculates a lower bound on the delay when given number of nodes, sources and a degree sequence in $G$ as an input.
The algorithm iteratively updates possible node degrees in $T^k$ in each time step $k$, and records the maximum possible number of nodes in $V_k$.
For the purpose of finding lower bounds, it is assumed that each node $v\in V_k$ with $\deg_{T^k}(v)<\deg_G(v)$ informs a new uninformed node.
The number of iterations is then the lowest possible delay for given input.
%The main idea is that in the most optimistic case, each node $v\in V_i$ with $\text{deg}_{F_i}(v)<\text{deg}_G(v)$ informs new not yet informed node.
%For the purpose of finding lower bounds, we can assume without loss of generality that $\text{deg}_{F_i}(u)\leq\text{deg}_{F_i}(v) \Leftrightarrow \text{deg}_G(u)\geq \text{deg}_G(v)$.
Once a node $v$ reaches its maximum degree, i.e., when $\text{deg}_{T^k}=\deg_G(v)$ for some $k$, $v$ does not inform any other node in the next time steps.

%For each $i=1,\dots d$, Alg. \ref{alg:dreg} keeps the  number of nodes with degree $i$.
%These values are updated iteratively using dynamic programming until the number of informed nodes reaches $n$. 

\begin{algorithm}
\KwData{$n,m,d_1,\dots,d_n\in \mathbb{N}, m\leq n,\newline 1\leq d_n\leq\dots\leq d_2\leq d_1$}

$a_{m+1}\leftarrow\dots\leftarrow a_{n}\leftarrow 0$\;%\tcp{this is a comment}

	\If {$a_i<d_i$} {
		$a_i\leftarrow a_i + 1$\;
		$c'\leftarrow c' + 1$\;
		\If {$c+c'\leq n$} {
			$a_{c+c'}\leftarrow 1$;\tcp{Newly informed node} 
		}
	}
}
$c\leftarrow c + c'$\;
}
\Return $k$\;
%\Return $\lceil k/s \rceil$\;

\end{algorithm}

The input is assumed to be correct in the sense that a graph with the given degree sequence exists, and by definition, the degree sequence is ordered non-increasingly.
For each iteration $k$, Alg.~\ref{alg:dreg} stores degrees of nodes in $T^k$ in variables $a_1,\dots,a_n$.
Note that the forest $T^k$ is not actually constructed. 
The algorithm operates merely with potential degrees of nodes in $T^k$.
Next, variable $c$ keeps the value $|V_k|$, i.e., the number nodes informed within $k$ steps.
Finally, $c'$ stores $|V_k\setminus V_{k-1}|$, thus the number of nodes newly informed in time step $k$.

\begin{proposition}
If $G$ is an arbitrary graph with $n$ nodes, $m$ sources and node degrees $d_i$, $1\leq i\leq n$, Alg.~\ref{alg:dreg} calculates a lower bound on the delay in $G$.
\label{prop:deg}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The assumption that nodes with higher degree in $G$ are informed first in the optimal solution is justified by Lemma \ref{lemma:degorder}.
In each iteration $k$, degrees in $T^k$ of maximum possible number of nodes are increased in the order of their decreasing degree.
The current maximum possible number of informed nodes is stored in the variable $c$, and is updated at the end of the outre loop.
So, when the condition $c<n$ is tested on line 7, $c$ contains the correct value of number of nodes in $V_k$.
As soon as it is possible that at least $n$ nodes are informed, the algorithm returns the number of necessary iterations.
\qed
